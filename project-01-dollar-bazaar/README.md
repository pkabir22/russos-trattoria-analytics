## Project Overview

A freelance analytics engagement for a retail business owner operating **three dollar store locations** across Queens and Brooklyn, NYC. The client had no visibility into store-level profitability, product margin performance, or seasonal trends — and was making inventory and staffing decisions on intuition alone.

This project delivered a fully interactive **Looker Studio dashboard** connected to structured Google Sheets data, giving the client a single source of truth across all three locations.

| **Locations** | Rego Park · Pomonok · Brooklyn (Queens & Brooklyn, NYC) |

## The Problem

> *"I have three stores and I have no idea which one is actually making me money after expenses. I know Brooklyn is busy but I don't know if busy means profitable. I also don't know which products I should be stocking more of and which ones are just taking up shelf space."*

**Key business questions the client needed answered:**
- Which store generates the most revenue — and which is most profitable after expenses?
- Which product categories drive margin vs. just volume?
- Which products are overstocked and tying up cash?
- How does labor cost compare to revenue by store and month?
- What are the seasonal patterns across 2 years?

---

## The Solution

### Data Architecture
Three structured data sources loaded into Google Sheets:

| File | Description | Rows |
|---|---|---|
| `alex_sales.csv` | Transaction-level POS export (2024–2025) | 75,269 |
| `alex_inventory.csv` | Product stock levels, reorder thresholds, stock value | 120 |
| `alex_expenses.csv` | Monthly expenses by store (rent, labor, utilities, misc) | 72 |

### Dashboard Structure
Built in **Google Looker Studio** with two interactive controls:
- **Store filter** — filter all visuals by individual location
- **Date range control** — slice by any custom date range

| Visual | Business Question Answered |
|---|---|
| 4 KPI Scorecards | Total Revenue · Gross Profit · Avg Margin · Units Sold |
| Revenue by Store (bar) | Which store drives the most top-line revenue? |
| Gross Profit by Store (bar) | Which store is most profitable? |
| Revenue by Category (bar) | Which product categories lead and lag? |
| Monthly Revenue Trend (line) | Seasonal patterns across all 3 stores, Jan 2024–Dec 2025 |

---

## Key Findings

### Store Performance
- **Brooklyn leads on revenue ($174K over 2 years)** but all three stores run near-identical gross margins (~42%) — meaning rent efficiency and labor management, not product mix, determines net profitability by location
- **Rego Park ($153K) and Pomonok ($128K)** trail Brooklyn but maintain healthy margins

### Product & Category Insights
- **Cleaning Supplies is the #1 revenue category** — drives ~17% of total revenue across all stores; consistent restocking priority
- **Stationery consistently underperforms** — lowest revenue per unit of shelf space; candidate for reduction or repricing
- **Food & Snacks** drives high volume but carries the lowest margin (~22%) — worth monitoring vs. higher-margin categories

### Seasonal Patterns
- **December revenue nearly doubles** vs. summer months in both 2024 and 2025 — a clear holiday spike giving the client a data-backed case to increase seasonal inventory orders ahead of Q4
- All stores show a mid-year dip (June–July) followed by recovery in September

### Year-over-Year Growth
- **Total revenue grew 8.6% from 2024 to 2025** ($218,742 → $237,576) — confirming the business is on a healthy growth trajectory
