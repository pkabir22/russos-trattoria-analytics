## Key Findings

- **Revenue grew ~22% from 2022 to 2024** and has sustained that trajectory into 2025–2026
- **Secondi (mains) dominate revenue** — Bistecca Tagliata and Osso Buco are the top 2 items by a significant margin
- **Dinner service (5–9pm) generates roughly 2× lunch revenue** — Friday and Saturday evenings are peak windows
- **Alcohol represents ~25% of total revenue** — Wine and Bar categories are meaningful contributors
- **VIP guests (~19% of the loyalty base) drive disproportionate revenue** — protecting this segment is critical
- **New Hyde Park and Floral Park are the top guest towns** — Garden City locals rank 4th despite being neighbors
- **Sofia Abbate leads server revenue** — alcohol upsell rates are consistent across the team
